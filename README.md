<h2>Ruby Language</h2>
--> To begin with Ruby, visit the official website &nbsp; <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Ruby_logo.svg/396px-Ruby_logo.svg.png" height=30px width=30px></a><br><br>
--> Download Ruby according to the platform being used like Linux, MacOs or Windows.<br><br>
--> Follow the setup wizard.<br><br>
--> Now there is irb(interactive ruby) in which we can directly write and execute ruby codes without having to create file.<br><br>
--> To use this simple type irb in command prompt of system.<br><br>
--> The problem with this is that once you exit the console, code will be deleted.<br><br>
--> To avoid this write ruby code in any text editor or IDE.<br><br>
--> Then just open the console and runt this command ruby filename.rb (filename is the name of the Ruby script) and output will be displayed.
<h2>Komodo IDE</h2>
